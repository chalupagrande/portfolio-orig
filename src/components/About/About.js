          I am a Fullstack Developer, Software Designer, and Artist currently working for IBM

        <p>And I know what you are thinking:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <h3>"WHY IS EVERYTHING IN COMIC SANS AND WITH NO STYLING!??! ARE YOU INSANE"</h3> <br />-{' '}

        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The short answer is, because I think it is <strong>funny</strong>. Also, there are a lot
          of benefits to making a site really boring, and using an annoying font. One, Comic Sans
          <sup>&reg;</sup> is scientifically proven to be easier to read! I read that somewhere. I
          don't know if it is true, but it probably is because...
        </p>
        <p>Two, the site is responsive!. Go ahead, resize the window!</p>

        <blockquote>
          <h3>"OOOOOOOOOOO! It is so responsive!"</h3> <br />- <strong>You</strong> (probably
          again...)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Not to mention. Not <i>reeaally</i> designing my site leaves me free to do a whole lot of
          other cool projects. Like potentially work on <strong>YOUR</strong> project! That is right
          people! I am available for hire. Play your cards right and you could have your own site as
          good as this one. But probably a lot better because I am actually pretty good at my job
          (despite your first impression). If you dont believe me, take a look at this!

        <p>
          You're right. Got a little carried away. <strong>BUT</strong> if by some strange stretch
          of the imagination you still aren't convinced, you can take a look at some of the other
          resources and determine for yourself.
